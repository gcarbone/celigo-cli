# Celigo CLI 

There was a need I saw to augment the deployment automation capabilities of the popular iPaaS platform, integrator.io by Celigo.  This project is an attempt to fill that need in a way that may support larger corporate organizations that require a N-tiered architecture and strict separation of production and non-production services.

Planned scope for this project includes command line access to your integrator.io account to:
- List integrations, flows, and related resources
- Export definitions of flows and their related resources
- Create new integrations, flows, and related resources
- Copy (promote) flows and integrations between accounts

## Tools used

The CLI uses node with the following packages:
- yargs
- columnify
- axios
- some others I probably forgot

## Version History
### This is a brief synopsis of the changes in each version.  Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to contribute.
